## 2025-05-24 - Visible Keyboard Hints
**Learning:** While `title` attributes with shortcuts (e.g., "Save (Ctrl+Enter)") are good, visible `<kbd>` hints directly on the button make these power-user features much more discoverable and satisfying to use.
**Action:** For repetitive editing interfaces, use small, visible keyboard shortcut indicators (e.g., `<kbd>Esc</kbd>`) next to or inside action buttons to encourage efficient keyboard usage.
