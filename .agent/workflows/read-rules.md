# Read Project Rules

Follow these steps at the start of every session or when asked to sync with rules:

1. Read the governance index file `AGENTS.md` in the project root.

2. Read all rule files in `.agent/rules/`:
   - `000-universal-sync.md` (Prime Directive)
   - `00-core-architecture.md` (Architecture Standards)
   - `01-stack-standards.md` (Tech Stack Standards)
   - `02-testing-coverage.md` (Testing Policy)

3. Apply these rules to all subsequent actions in this session.

4. When modifying any rule file, immediately update all related config files (`.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.copilot-instructions`, `.geminirules`, `AGENTS.md`).
