# Universal Sync Mandate (The Prime Directive)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This directory is the Single Source of Truth for all AI behavior.**

1.  **Sync Mandate:** If you (the Agent) modify ANY rule in this directory (`.agent/rules/`), you **MUST** immediately update `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and any other model config file to match. Never allow files to drift.
2.  **Model Agnostic:** These rules apply equally to Gemini, Claude, Grok, and Codex. Do not hallucinate model-specific exemptions.
3.  **Read-First:** At the start of every session, you must ingest `AGENTS.md` (which indexes this folder) to ground your context.
